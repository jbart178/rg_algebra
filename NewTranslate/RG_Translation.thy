Here we give translations for the Rely-Guarantee calculus.
Importing this file will enable the translatinoal framework to take affect in the theory.
This theory is a wrapper for a tranmslation which should ensure the same representation is used 
across theories. 
Particular implmentations are given in separate theories although should not be imported into theory 
directly due to risk of cross contamination.
